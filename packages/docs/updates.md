# Updates

{{ description }}

## October 2020

- Added a [Website Header component](/components/website-header).
- Added a ["Used by" section to component pages](/components/universal-header/#used-by) to highlight what components are being used and where.

## August 2020

- Added an [offline message to the Chat component](/components/chat).
- Added an [accessibility statement to our support page](/support/#accessibility).

## July 2020

We finally have a way to create our own [HTML elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html) and use them in any framework we want. This update is our investment in that web standard and our first public release.

The redesigned [library website](https://www.lib.umich.edu/) was launched and is built with the Design System ðŸ¤©. Also, [Library Search](https://search.lib.umich.edu/) and [MGet It](https://mgetit.lib.umich.edu/) have been updated to use the Universal Header and Chat.

- Added [Color](/design-tokens#color) and [Space](/design-tokens#space) design tokens available as CSS custom properties.
- Added a [Chat component](/components/chat).
- Added a [Universal Header component](/components/universal-header).
- Redesigned public documentation with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).

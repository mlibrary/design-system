# University of Michigan Library Icons

This package includes University of Michigan Library icons and related tools.

## Usage

The recommended way to use Duet Icons is through our npm package. To install, simply run:

```
npm isntall @umich-lib/icons
```

The API can then be used as follows

```
import icons from "@umich-lib/icons"

/*
{
  title: 'search',
  svg: '<svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" ...'
}
*/
```

See [University of Michigan Library Design System documentation](https://design-system.lib.umich.edu/iconography).

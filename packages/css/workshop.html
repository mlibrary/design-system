    <h1 class="page-heading">Share and Preserve Your Work</h1>

    <p>Do you have articles, chapters, <a href="https://www.lib.umich.edu">conference presentations</a>, media, or other work that you would like to keep in one place and make accessible?</p>
    <p>Consider Deep Blue, our digital repository for research, teaching, and creative work at the University of Michigan. Once your work is deposited in Deep Blue, we’ll preserve it and provide you with permanent links to share your items.</p>

    <h2>Why share my work in a repository?</h2>

    <p>Adding your work to a <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/documents">digital repository like Deep Blue</a> helps make sure your work is openly available, accessible, and preserved in a stable place —  whether it’s a slide deck, syllabi, article preprint, or related documents.</p>
    <p>In a repository, your <a href="#test">academic work</a> will generally receive:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>A stable URL</strong>, called a handle in Deep Blue, which you can share with others or post to social media, your personal website, and more. You won’t have to worry about broken links, or migrating and re-posting your work to a new web page if you move to a new institution.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Indexing by Google and Google Scholar</strong>, which makes your work more discoverable by others
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Statistics about usage and engagement with your work</strong>, including download counts and alternative metrics.
      </li>
    </ul>

## Contribute to repo

Getting started:

```
git clone https://github.com/mlibrary/design-system.git
cd design-system
npm install
```

Install, hoist, and share dependencies between packages:

```
npm run lerna:bootstrap
```

Build the packages:

```
npm run build
```

Start development with either:

```
npm run develop
```

```
npm start
```

Once started, a development environment of local packages for `@umich-lib/docs` is available at http://localhost:8080/ and `@umich-lib/components` at http://localhost:3333/.

For changes between packages to appear, stop the packages, rerun `npm build` then `npm start`. For example, for a `@umich-lib/css` change to appearing in `@umich-lib/docs`.

Each package has a CONTRIBUTING.md file for further details specific to that package.

## Publish packages

You'll need access to the NPM `@umich-lib` group, but then run the following and answer the prompts.

```
lerna:publish
```
